# to communicate with your MCP servers.

# Example for github server
if [ "$SERVER" == "github" ]; then
  # Here you would implement the logic to send a request
  # to the github-mcp-server.
  # This might involve using curl or another tool to send
  # a request to the running server.

  # Example: curl -X POST http://localhost:PORT/github -d "{"tool": "$TOOL", "args": "$ARGS"}"

# Add more 'if' or 'case' statements for your other servers (gcp, postgres, etc.)
