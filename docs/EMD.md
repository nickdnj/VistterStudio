# External Marketing Document (EMD): VistterStudio + Wyze Bridge

This document outlines the external marketing and communication strategy for VistterStudio.

## 1. Product Overview

VistterStudio is a free, open-source solution that unlocks the full potential of your Wyze cameras. It provides a simple, Docker-based setup to access live video streams from your cameras in standard formats like RTSP, RTMP, and HLS. This allows you to integrate your affordable Wyze cameras with professional broadcasting software, media servers, or your own custom applications, just like you would with high-end equipment.

## 2. Target Market

*   **Content Creators & Live Streamers:** Individuals and teams who produce live content on platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook Live and want to add more camera angles to their productions without a large investment in new hardware.
*   **Local Broadcasters & Community Organizations:** Small-scale television stations, community centers, and houses of worship that need affordable and easy-to-manage cameras for broadcasting local events, services, or public access channels.
*   **Tech-Savvy Hobbyists & DIY Enthusiasts:** Makers and developers who want to incorporate live video into their projects, from home automation dashboards with real-time security feeds to creative art installations.
*   **Small Businesses:** Companies that want to use live video for security monitoring, quality control, or streaming events, but need a more flexible solution than the standard Wyze app.
